# Lossless-Image-Compression-using-Matlab
Cameras are nowadays being provided with more and more megapixels to improve the quality of captured images. With improvement in image quality, size of the image file also increases. One of the applications of image compression with MATLAB using a graphical user interface is described in this project. This project proposes a technique to compress.
